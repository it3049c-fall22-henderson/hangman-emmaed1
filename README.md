I like this assignment becuase it was a lot of trial and error with the game so playing it many times to see if it was working is the most fun part.
### How long it took me to finish this?
This assignment took a few days to finalize. I did most of the work the first day and it only took me about 3-4 hours, after that it was mostly logic and minor details.
